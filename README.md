## User Stories

- I am presented with a series of random button presses
- Each time I input a series of button presses correctly, I see the same series of button presses with an additional step added.
- Each button press is accompanied by a sound
- If I press the wrong button, I get a notification, and the series of presses starts again. 
- I can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses
- If I want to restart, there is a button for it. The button starts a new series with a single step
- There is a 'strict mode', that resets to a new series of button presses after I make a mistake.
- I can win the game by correctly repeating a series of 20 button presses. Upon succesful completion, I get a notification, then the game starts over.
