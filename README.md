## User Stories

- **OK** I am presented with a series of random button presses
- **OK** Each time I input a series of button presses correctly, I see the same series of button presses with an additional step added.
- **OK** Each button press is accompanied by a sound
- **OK** If I press the wrong button, I get a notification, and the series of presses starts again. *Needs better user feedback* 
- **OK** I can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses
- **OK** If I want to restart, there is a button for it. The button starts a new series with a single step
- **OK** There is a 'strict mode', that resets to a new series of button presses after I make a mistake.
- **OK** I can win the game by correctly repeating a series of 20 button presses. Upon succesful completion, I get a notification, then the game starts over.
